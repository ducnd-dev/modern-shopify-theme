```bash
Priority 1: Create missing core snippets
├── price.liquid (product pricing display)
├── product-variant-options.liquid (size, color options)
└── card-product.liquid (product card component)

Priority 2: Create essential JavaScript
├── product-form.js (add to cart functionality)
├── product-info.js (product interactions)
└── share.js (social sharing)

Priority 3: Create core icons
├── icon-minus.liquid, icon-plus.liquid (quantity controls)
├── icon-share.liquid (sharing)
└── icon-close.liquid (modals)
```

### Phase 2: Quality Improvements (Recommended)
```bash
□ Add width/height to all images
□ Create missing CSS assets
□ Fix hardcoded routes
□ Complete translation keys
□ Fix unknown filter issues
```

### Phase 3: Production Ready
```bash
□ Performance optimization

□ Mobile responsiveness verification
```
